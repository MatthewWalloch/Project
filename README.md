An implementation of [Giuseppe Patan√©'s Meshless Discrete Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition]( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9166766/) for Glacier velocities.

The jupiter notebook will calulate the galcier velcoites and an example output in included.

Visualization was done in Paraview, the pipline file is also included in which the file is the example from the jupiter output.

The paper explains the results and includes figures generated by the code.

The data is from [Comparison of ice dynamics using full-Stokes and Blatter-Pattyn approximation: application to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream](https://zenodo.org/records/6406103)
