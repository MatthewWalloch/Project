An implementation of [Giuseppe Patan√©'s Meshless Discrete Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition]( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9166766/) for Glacier velocities.

The jupiter notebook will calulate the galcier velcoites. 
Visualization was done in Paraview, the pipline file is also included, an example is also included.

The paper explains the results and includes figures generated by the code.

The data is from [Comparison of ice dynamics using full-Stokes and Blatter-Pattyn approximation: application to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream](https://zenodo.org/records/6406103)
